# Choreography

Let's assume we have music that is nominally chosen to be "spin compatible".

For example, we expect EDM music to be compatible. More broadly, it could be
any music with a certain tempo.

Candidate music selection is probably possible via curation of genres and potentially a folksonomy (or taxonomy) of
additional factors, like "energetic" or "motivational" etc.

Two challenges:

1. Identifying phases of music that we can map moves to.
2. Mapping moves to phases in a coherent way.

## Phase (Feature) Extraction

Let's start here to see how we might identify phases.

Let's have some canonical tracks that we know how to choreograph.

[Track 1](/Users/paulg/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music/Unknown Artist/Unknown Album/01 Track 01.m4a)
[Track 2](/Users/paulg/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music/Unknown Artist/Unknown Album/02 Track 02.m4a)
[Track 3](/Users/paulg/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music/Unknown Artist/Unknown Album/04 RPM track 07.m4a)
[Track 4](/Users/paulg/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music/Unknown Artist/Unknown Album/06 RPM track 11.m4a)
[Track 5](/Users/paulg/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music/Unknown Artist/Unknown Album/07 Track 07.m4a)

Here we need a method for [segmentation](segmentation.md)
