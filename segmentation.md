# Segmentation

We want to find segments of self-similar musical structure. Or, more broadly, we want to know the structure of the music.

Our concern here is mostly for EDM or pop music as the two prominent genres for spin cycling.

# Musical Background

We should obviously know the inherent hierarchies in the target genres.

[This tutorial](https://subaqueousmusic.com/dubstep-and-electronic-music-song-structure/) about EDM song structure is a good start.


# Technical Approaches

## State of the Art & Background Etc.

A method by Brian McFee as used in [Librosa](http://librosa.github.io/librosa/) - see [Laplacian Segmentation](http://librosa.github.io/librosa/auto_examples/plot_segmentation.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-plot-segmentation-py)
uses [Spectral Clustering]() - see [McFee's paper here](/docs/ismir2014_spectral_segmentation.pdf)

Some technical background resources:

- [Video explaining spectral clustering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-LEH-AFovE) in general
- [Video explanation of Laplacian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkgm0i77jQ8)
- [Another video for spectral clustering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgsJZYGeAz4)
With a seminal video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BqbktGo2Vs&index=10&list=PLdk2fd27CQzT7opzoGHvqDuDbltozWn7O)

### Analysis of Papers/Ideas

We want to analyze the [approach of McFee](/docs/ismir2014_spectral_segmentation.pdf)
